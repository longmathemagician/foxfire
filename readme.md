# Foxfire
Styled after applications of yore, Foxfire is a simple and lightweight image viewer written with Rust + Druid. It features:

* Folder parsing for surrounding images
* Option to set the current image as the desktop background
* Option to open the current image in another compatible program (buggy on macOS)
* UI element background blurring (hardware accelerated on Windows)
* Option to display images with or without bilinear filtering
* Multiplatform compatibility: Linux + GNOME/KDE + systemd, Windows, macOS
* System dark/light theme integration
* And most importantly, 
* *A cute bird*
